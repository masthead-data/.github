# Masthead Data

**Observability for your Google Cloud data platform**

Catch silent data issues, broken pipelines, and cost anomalies before they hit your dashboards — all without giving us access to your data.

---

## How it works

* **BigQuery observability** — Track pipeline health, latency, and schema drift across projects.
* **Anomaly detection** — Get alerts when data volume, freshness, or spend deviates from normal.
* **Lineage & metadata graph** — Auto-discover how datasets flow across BigQuery, Looker, and Cloud SQL.
* **FinOps insights** — Surface heavy queries, idle jobs, and ghost pipelines; optimize compute spend.
* **Privacy by design** — We read metadata, not data. No external data access. Full GDPR/HIPAA compliance.

## Why engineers love it

* Setup in **<15 min**, full observability within hours.
* No ETL hooks or external agents.
* Works natively with GCP IAM & logs.
* 10–50% cost reduction observed in early usage.
